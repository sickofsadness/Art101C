			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I had a hard time deciding what to actually include for the lists and how to determine
						what should count as the main action versus a sub action. Also trying to figure out where
					everything is supposed to go in the code was a bit difficult.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Jackie brought up the question about if we were supposed to write the comments in lowercase. I
						then realized how many uppercase letters I wrote in my list, so I went back and changed all of
					the upper case to lower case. We both thought it would be good practice to keep everything lowercased.
				I was also struggling to identify how to write the rules for the game so that the game can identify if the
			computer or the player won. I just ended up writing all the possibilites that could happen with rock, paper, and scissors. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I chose topics that really resonated with me, especially the New England Clam Chowder. I think
						it was a good idea for me and Jackie to do different ideas because what he wanted to do was something
					I didn't quite understand, and I thought making a list would be easier if I understood my topic more. Also,
					sometimes I think that placing things into lists isn't as easy as it seems, because a subcategory could actually
				be the main catergory, but to my interpretation it was a bit confusing. </p>
