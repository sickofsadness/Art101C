					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>At first, I struggled with trying to find the right folder to put the HTML in, until I realized that
						it was just editing our homepage. I was looking at the lab 3 folder the entire time, and thinking 
						about how I was going to integrate the lab into the lab 3 file. After I figured that out, I had trouble 
						getting my links to work.
						 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble getting my links on my website to actually link to my other webpage. I put my code into ChatGPT,
						and it told me I was just missing ".." at the beginning of the file I wanted to link it to.
						</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It wasn't as easy as I thought. I started off really rough, but I eventually understood the assignment an hour
						later. Even though I struggled, I was able to eventualy learn how to attach an image in my code and also how to 
						link to other websites on my website. I was asking my partner for help and trying to troubleshoot what was  wrong.
						</p>
