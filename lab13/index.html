			<h1> Lab 13 - Loops </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We had to use Javascript to use a "for loop" which goes through each number until 200, and if they're multiple of 3, 5, and 7
                        then they say Fizz! Buzz! and Boom! respectively. If there is a number that's both a multiple of 2 of the numbers, then 
                        it prints a combination of words. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My code wasn't printing in the output in the beginning, and I realized it was because I had included
                        the output into the loop, so it wasn't outside. After I moved the .html in the JS outside, it printed.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had a bit of trouble trying to understand the live code in class, but after I took a picture of it and looked
                        at it more, I understood the if, else if, and else function and the positions that they had to be in. It's 
                        very reminiscent of what I remember learning in Python, as these looping functions were the only one I remember
                        being able to figure out on my own. It's really cool to see my code working and being output onto
                        my website. </p>
