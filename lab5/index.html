<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I couldn't get the code that shows in Canvas to work. Also the way that we did it in class,
						I tried to implement it into my code on VSCode, but it still wouldn't work.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I couldn't get the document.ln function to work, and I tried WesBot and also ChatGPT. From
						ChatGPT, I learned that apparently document.ln is supposed to erase what's on the webpage,
					but then replaces it with what's written. I thought there may have been something in my HTML that wasn't working,
				but it was just fine, and my js was linked correctly. So I ended up having to use a different function, similar to
			what we learned in class on 4/24, to be able to show it on my webpage. But, then I started putting my pictures in,
			and I realized that they weren't showing up. SO, I turned to ChatGPT to find out what was wrong. After a bunch of
			back and forth, I finally tried comparing me and Jackie's code (which worked), with my own. At first I just put the entire block 
			of text in, but then after I realized that wasn't working, I decided to examine specific parts of the code. I eventually realized it was the 
			bottom half of my HTML code that wasn't working, and upon asking ChatGPT, it said I didn't have heading 3, which is where the Script Output 
			was supposed to go. After seeing this, I realized that it was a seperate section UNDER the results section which is where the jsscript was
			supposed to be showing up. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I spent about a few hours on this assignment trying to get the code to work. I think upon further reflection, if I have more 
						problems I should reread the steps on Canvas. I think I initially saw it, but then since I was already jumping around all the
						steps, I forgot about it, and in my plight to debug and find what was wrong, I finally got it. </p>
