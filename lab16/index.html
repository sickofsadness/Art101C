					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> In this Lab, we needed to use an API website and display the comic on our own output. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I took a long time to figure out what was wrong with my code. I had a lot of trouble trying to
						figure out how to get the API key or what links I was supposed to use in order to get the 
						correct output on my website. Eventually, I asked my partner and also my group project group
						for help if any of them had solved it, and they showed me what worked for them. So, I also
						tried it out and it worked out as well.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> It was really frustrating trying to figure out what to do, but I eventually figured it out
						with help from my group mates. I don't really understand what I've added to my code or how it works.
						I might look more into it, but as of right now I don't get what I've done.
					</p>
