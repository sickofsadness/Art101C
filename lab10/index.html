					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this Lab, we needed to create a button in the results section that would spawn in
						a text bubble everytime a button is clicked.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I had problems after I copied the code into my JS where the words were showing above
						the button and the text wasn't applied to the button. Then I realized that I didn't
						put the code inside of the anonymous function. A problem I still have now is that my images
						aren't showing up after my button. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have much time to work on this Lab so I tried to just make sure that the code
						I copied was being shown on my website.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
