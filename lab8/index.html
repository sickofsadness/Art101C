					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The point of this lab was to use the console to practice using callbacks and anonymous functions 
                        within those callbacks. We needed to create an array, then a function, and then we needed to
                        manipulate our array using the function we just created. We also used a callback to use an anon function
                        in order ot 
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems trying to figure out where to include the links into the header, but I think by
                    default for this template, it was already in the correct place. So although I did add it in, I 
                    looked through the code to see if there was somethign similar happening, and when I noticed I just deleted 
                    what I added and left it as is, and a lot of the errors in the console disappeared. I also had a bit of 
                    trouble trying to show the callback function that I created in the console, and when I asked the internet how
                    to put it in the console, they suggested directly putting console.log in front of the code. So, I did that and
                    it showed up in my console thankfully. I also tried my hand at trying to show the results for mapResults, and it
                    sort of worked, but it doesn't have any spaces in between and I wanted to show more results. I didn't know how
                    to, so I tried messing around with the code to no avail, so it just simply shows the results for mapResults. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I had a lot of fun with this lab, and it makes me want to explore further what I can do with
                        HTML and JavaScript. I think that I really tried to mess around with my console and my JavaScript by creating 
                        two different functions for each to showcase. </p>
