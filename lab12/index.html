					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this Lab, we had to make an else if function to determine if the remainder was divisible by 4 to
                        get 0 or if the remainder is 1-4 based on the number of letters submitted in the input box.
                    </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I didn't have any text in my button, which just showed up as a small oval that I couldn't
                        click. Then I realized I needed to add text to make it a clickable button. Then, after I finished
                        my lab I wanted to make it so that each different element would have their own color when
                        showing in the input. To do that, I had to change my code a bit and assign my objects to a 
                        class, so that it was be easier to edit the color of the names. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm pretty proud of myself because I actually went a little bit farther beyond what was just asked of me and
                        sprinkled in a little bit of CSS to add to my JS. But, that change made me change a bit about my JS but not
                        too much. I think it adds a nice flare though.  </p>
