			<h1> Hello World </h1>

			<p> My name is Lavinia and I really like foxes, crocheting, reading books, and playing games on my PC. I'm a 3rd
				year transfer at UCSC in the AGPM Major, with the Literature in Minor. I also plan to study abroad next year!
				My partner for Lab 2 is Jackie Kuang, and we're both in the same section. He is really into cars and gambling.
				He also really likes competitve games.
