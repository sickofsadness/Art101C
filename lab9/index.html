					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab is to create buttons for the challenge, problems, and results section. </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had a problem where 2 buttons were showing up for each section. I tried to look and see if
						there was anything in my JavaScript that was somehow causing two buttons to show up. When that
						didn't work, I looked through the css and the html, and I realized because I copied the Lab code from 
						Lab 7 to create Lab 9's template, there was a JS code that was already showing up after the results.
						So, my JavaScript was running twice, and once I removed that last part in my HTML, only one button
						started showing up. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel really proud for what I manaegd to accomplish in my code. I also decided to play around with
						the buttons and give them their own colors. I had a lot of fun clicking the buttons and seeing
						what happened to the text afterwards. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Click the buttons to see the results! </p>
